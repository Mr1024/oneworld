  "readme": "tcp-ping\n========\n\nTCP ping utility for node.js. You can test if chosen address accepts connections at desired port and find out your latency. Great for service availability testing.\n\n#####Why not ```ping``` wrapper?\n\n* It's much faster than ```ping``` tool (as soon as connection gets accepted, it's dropped and a new measure is conducted immediately), so there's no unnecessary waiting between requests.\n* It allows you to test a specific service, not the whole connection\n* Some servers drop ICMP echo without any response, even when online. TCP can work in such cases.\n\n###Install\n\n```\nnpm install tcp-ping\n```\n\n###Functions\n\n#####ping(options, callback)\n\n```options``` is an object, which may contain several properties:\n\n* address (address to ping; defaults to ```localhost```)\n* port (defaults to ```80```)\n* timeout (in ms; defaults to 5s)\n* attempts (how many times to measure time; defaults to 10)\n\n```callback``` should be a function with arguments in node convention - ```function(err, data)```.\n\nReturned data is an object which looks like this:\n```javascript\n{\n  address: '46.28.246.123',\n  port: 80,\n  attempts: 10,\n  avg: 19.7848844,\n  max: 35.306233,\n  min: 16.526067,\n  results:\n   [\n    { seq: 0, time: 35.306233 },\n    { seq: 1, time: 16.585919 },\n    ...\n    { seq: 9, time: 17.625968 }\n   ]\n}\n```\n\n#####probe(address, port, callback)\n```callback``` is a node style callback ```function(err, data)```, where data is true if the server is available and false otherwise.\n\n###Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar tcpp = require('tcp-ping');\n\ntcpp.probe('46.28.246.123', 80, function(err, available) {\n    console.log(available);\n});\n\ntcpp.ping({ address: '46.28.246.123' }, function(err, data) {\n    console.log(data);\n});\n```",
